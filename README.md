# Workshop

This repository can be used to learn how to do integrated security testing

## Basic Concepts

Welcome to Hacking Aikido. Hackido. You don't use brute force to find security bugs, you use leverage. 
By leverage, I other people's existing integration tests.

The whole plan of this is to leverage existing integration tests to find real world security bugs inside a web application.
Get ready, and I'll show you the way of integrated security testing. 

"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall *hack the planet*"

## Understand the Test Framework

### Selenium and other elements

This example uses the selenium web driver to test the web ui. All you really need to know is that selenium will interact with a web application via the browser just like a user.
